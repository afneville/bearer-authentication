# MERN_chat_application

This is a full stack application, using Node JS and the Express framework to manage secure routes to data held in a mongodb database.
It will also include a react JS frontend, consuming the api.

A config directory is needed to store the password for the database and the secret salt for using the JS web tokens. It is not included, for security reasons. The specific file is called: keys.js, so you should create something like: config/keys.js
